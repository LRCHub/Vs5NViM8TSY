[00:01.24] I don't need anything.
[00:04.24] 
[00:24.43] My heart was racing. Every step left me breathless.
[00:29.43] I skipped out on my first part-time job
[00:32.21] Music and life—I didn't care about either anymore.
[00:36.94] All I've gotten is more things I dislike.
[00:45.44] One August night, moonlight, flying on a bicycle
[00:41.49] 
[00:45.71] Higashifushimi Viaduct, Kodaira, Fujimi Street and Shopping District
[00:50.29] The night breeze tickled my nose.
[00:52.38] This pain in my chest is just in my head.
[00:54.75] I knew it. I pretended to understand.
[01:02.25] The worst. The worst.
[01:00.84] 
[01:03.19] Everything about me is the worst.
[01:05.24] I wanted to preserve you in a tangible form
[01:07.01] I'll never let it become a memory
[01:14.01] The worst. The worst.
[01:09.59] I can't help but feel so good.
[01:11.95] 
[01:14.32] Even these lyrics themselves are the worst
[01:20.32] If I could die at twenty-seven
[01:18.43] 
[01:20.94] Rock 'n' roll saved me.
[01:23.39] Stop thinking! I'm going to die anyway.
[01:27.44] You don't need anything either.
[01:31.94] 
[01:51.29] My heart was racing.
[01:53.65] I was so thirsty I could have laughed.
[01:56.35] For the first time, I put my heart up for sale.
[01:59.69] Angina and pride—I didn't care about either anymore.
[02:04.19] I bowed my head even to those I disliked.
[02:11.19] One August day, I crossed over the scenery of those days.
[02:08.85] 
[02:13.25] Stockholm street vendors
[02:15.01] Kiruna, Gamla Stan is paved with cobblestones
[02:17.63] I kept only you in my heart
[02:19.47] The blue of this sky is just a figment of my imagination.
[02:21.96] She was smiling, still wearing that smile.
[02:27.96] 
[02:28.16] You're the worst. Arrogant. You're all greedy.
[02:32.60] Dramatic songs and love, come on
[02:34.76] It's so ridiculous I can't stand it.
[02:36.60] I knew it. I knew it.
[02:39.20] Your life is yours.
[02:41.46] No matter how much you scream it's the worst
[02:47.46] That's right, it must be.
[02:45.98] 
[02:47.78] Rock 'n' roll plays in the afterlife.
[02:50.43] Hymns aren't popular.
[02:52.43] There's no God, after all.
[02:54.77] Crimes, mistakes, offenses, suicides, wars
[02:58.76] I don't know all the minorities either.
[03:05.26] 
[03:22.44] You're the worst. You're the worst. Breaking up is just arrogant.
[03:27.07] I want to nod to everything about you
[03:29.02] That's just deception, Elma.
[03:36.02] The worst. The worst.
[03:31.47] I just can't help but adore you
[03:33.69] I want to mourn me on a dramatic night
[03:35.96] 
[03:43.46] The worst. The worst. Words are redundant.
[03:40.26] 
[03:44.33] Your life is moonlight.
[03:46.54] I won't let anyone say it's commonplace.
[03:54.04] The worst. The worst.
[03:48.80] It's no use getting laughed at.
[03:51.09] The lyrics are just a play on words
[03:53.04] 
[03:59.54] If I could die at twenty-seven
[03:57.39] 
[04:00.33] Rock 'n' roll saved me.
[04:02.58] Stop thinking! I'm going to die anyway.
[04:11.58] Even now, love, the past, dreams
[04:06.41] 
[04:14.96] Memories, humming, half-closed eyes, and the evening haze
[04:19.56] Kindness, pain, blossoms, and melancholy
[04:23.66] That summer, and this song too
[04:25.63] Hypocrisy, the night breeze, lies, you, me, the open sky
[04:29.95] I don't need anything.
